# DonorX

Organ and blood donation is an issue of major concern today. On surveying, we found that in many cases, the lack of availability of the same is not the major challenge. The absence of efficient means of directing blood and organs from donors to recipients is the greater hurdle. Published statistics say that nearly 150,000 patients need kidney transplants annually. But the hospitals manage to get only around 5,000 kidney donors.  The objective is to reduce this gap between donors and recipients. The main project verticals are an Android application, a supporting website, and an SQL database.  A person in need of an organ or particular blood group could check the availability of the same on the app or website. He/She would be informed of a hospital or blood bank having the required organ or blood group nearest to his/her given location.
